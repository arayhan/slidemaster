# Stop hook - nudges once when core docs changed but AGENTS.md did not.
#
# What it can and cannot do: detecting "PRD changed, AGENTS.md did not" is pure git and
# fully mechanical. Judging whether the change was MAJOR enough to warrant a AGENTS.md
# update is not automatable. So this nudges; it never gates. "Deliberate, no update
# needed" is a valid answer and a false positive costs one line of reply.
#
# Anti-loop: a Stop hook must exit 2 for its message to reach Claude, and exit 2 blocks
# the turn from ending. On the re-fire the harness passes stop_hook_active=true, and
# bailing on that is the ONLY thing preventing infinite recursion. Do not remove it.
#
# Never blocks on its own failure: any error path exits 0. A broken hook that wedges the
# session is far worse than a missed nudge.

Update AGENTS.md only if the change crossed the threshold in its "When to update this
file" section: phase structure, a hard rule, tech stack, folder structure, a
cross-cutting convention, install/run commands, or repo scope.

Task detail, DoD checkboxes, and rationale prose do NOT qualify - if this was one of
those, say "deliberate, no AGENTS.md update needed" and finish. This nudge fires ONCE
PER SESSION and will not ask again, so answer it rather than deferring.
